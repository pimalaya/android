## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The setup names sending in the words of the setup it is in
The connection flow SHALL offer where mail is submitted as part of connecting mail, and SHALL name it the way the chosen setup names everything else. The standard setup SHALL offer one switch reading *send mail*, carrying no protocol, on when the discovery run turned up an endpoint this client can drive and off and unswitchable when it did not, naming the setup that can connect it. The advanced setup SHALL list, under a switched-on mail section, one row per discovered submission configuration, a row for none, and manual entry. Implicit TLS only, this client having no STARTTLS step. Submission SHALL sign in with the credential the mail connection signed in with, and the flow SHALL NOT prompt a second time.

#### Scenario: An address that publishes submission
- GIVEN an address whose discovery turned up an implicit-TLS SMTP endpoint
- WHEN the standard setup switches mail on
- THEN a *send mail* switch is shown on under it
- AND no protocol is named anywhere on the screen

#### Scenario: An address that publishes none
- GIVEN an address whose discovery turned up no submission this client can drive
- WHEN the standard setup is shown
- THEN the *send mail* switch is off, unswitchable, and says the advanced setup can connect it

#### Scenario: The same address, advanced
- GIVEN the same address
- WHEN the advanced setup switches mail on
- THEN the section lists its SMTP configurations, a row for none, and manual entry
- AND manual entry asks for a host and builds an implicit-TLS endpoint on port 465 when none was typed

#### Scenario: Sending switched off
- GIVEN an address that publishes submission
- WHEN the flow finishes with sending switched off
- THEN the account stores no submit endpoint, and is not offered as a sender

### Requirement: An account can gain a sender after it is connected
The account settings screen SHALL show, for an account covering mail, where that account submits, and SHALL let it be entered, changed or emptied. What is entered is read the way the advanced setup reads it: a host, or a host and a port, as an implicit-TLS endpoint on port 465 by default. Changing it SHALL leave the account's credential and the endpoint it reads from alone, and SHALL take effect without a sign-in.

#### Scenario: An account connected before submission existed
- GIVEN a mail account carrying no submit endpoint
- WHEN one is entered in its settings
- THEN the account is offered as a sender, with no reconnection and no second sign-in

#### Scenario: Emptying it
- GIVEN a mail account that sends
- WHEN the field is emptied
- THEN the account stores no submit endpoint and is no longer offered as a sender

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A mail account carries where it submits and where its trash is
A mail connection SHALL carry the endpoint mail is submitted through, beside the one it is read from, chosen in the connection flow from what discovery turned up or from what was entered by hand, and stored with it. Implicit TLS only: this client has no STARTTLS step, and driving a `starttls` endpoint as if it were implicit would hand a message over in the clear rather than fail. Every other domain carries none, and so does a mail account whose backend submits through the endpoint it reads from, or whose sending was switched off.

The account SHALL also record the mailbox the server marks `\Trash` (RFC 6154), refreshed by every mail sync from the roster the LIST builds, so a delete decides between a move and a marker with no round trip.

#### Scenario: An address that publishes both
- GIVEN an address whose discovery turns up IMAP and SMTP
- WHEN the mail domain is connected over IMAP with sending on
- THEN the account stores both endpoints

#### Scenario: An account stored before submission existed
- GIVEN an account connected by an earlier version
- WHEN it is read back
- THEN it carries no submit endpoint, and is not offered as a sender until one is entered in its settings

#### Scenario: A roster that found a trash
- GIVEN a server marking one mailbox `\Trash`
- WHEN the account is synced
- THEN that mailbox is recorded, and read back with no network to ask

### Requirement: A message is sent through an outbox
Submitting SHALL compose the message on the device and stage it as one action on the store's queue: the app's own `submit` kind, a versioned payload naming the sender and what a listing draws, and the composed message written to the blob directory and pinned by the enqueue, all in the one transaction the standard prescribes for a producer. The payload carries the subject and the date because a waiting message is not an item and has no summary row beside it, and parsing a message to draw a list is what the sort key exists to avoid.

The queued actions of an account SHALL be shown as its outbox, above everything the store synced, and discarding one SHALL cancel its row and release its pin, there being nothing anywhere to tell. A parked one SHALL be shown too, saying it was refused rather than that it is waiting: a message the sender wrote is not something to drop quietly.

#### Scenario: Composed with no network
- GIVEN no network
- WHEN a message is sent
- THEN its action is queued, the message shows as pending, and the composer closes

#### Scenario: A refresh over it
- GIVEN a message waiting to be sent
- WHEN the account's mailboxes are re-listed
- THEN it is still there, a queue row being no collection's to replace

#### Scenario: Discarding one
- GIVEN a queued message
- WHEN it is discarded
- THEN its row is cancelled and the body it pinned is released

### Requirement: A message is submitted and a copy is kept
A sync draining the queue SHALL take an account's pending actions in append order and hand each message's bytes to the account's submit endpoint with the envelope its own address headers name, the `Bcc` among them, that header leaving the bytes on the way out so no copy a recipient receives names a blind one. It SHALL then `APPEND` the stripped copy into the mailbox the server marks `\Sent` (RFC 6154), already `\Seen`. The copy SHALL be filed after the submission and never instead of it, and a copy that could not be filed SHALL NOT be a reason to run the action again: the message has gone, and sending it a second time to file a record of it is worse than the missing record. An account with no sent mailbox SHALL send anyway and say no copy was kept.

The row SHALL be removed by cancelling it once the message has been handed over, and never claimed before: a submission's effect is not a store mutation, so there is nothing to apply, and a claim that deleted the row before the server accepted the message would lose the message. Submission is therefore at-least-once, and a drain interrupted between the handover and the cancel SHALL send the message again.

A submission the server refuses for good, which is a 5yz reply (RFC 5321 section 4.2.1), SHALL park the row with what the server said, counted as one attempt, shown as failed to send and never retried on its own; the drain SHALL carry on to the rows behind it. Any other failure SHALL count an attempt, leave the row pending and stop the drain, the usual cause being that there is no network and the next message would fail too. An action of a kind this app does not carry out SHALL be left pending and untouched, its attempts unbumped.

#### Scenario: The next sync
- GIVEN a queued message and an account with a submit endpoint and a `\Sent` mailbox
- WHEN the sync drains the queue
- THEN it is handed over, a copy carrying no `Bcc` is filed, and the row is cancelled

#### Scenario: A submission the server refuses
- GIVEN a server answering the envelope with a 5yz reply
- WHEN the sync drains the queue
- THEN nothing is filed anywhere, the row is parked carrying the error, and the message shows as failed to send

#### Scenario: One refusal among several
- GIVEN two queued messages, the first of which is refused
- WHEN the sync drains the queue
- THEN the second is still handed over

#### Scenario: No network
- GIVEN a queued message and no network
- WHEN the sync drains the queue
- THEN the attempt is counted, the message stays queued, and the drain stops there

#### Scenario: The copy cannot be filed
- GIVEN a submission the server accepted and a `\Sent` mailbox that refuses the `APPEND`
- WHEN the drain finishes the message
- THEN the row is cancelled anyway and nothing offers the message again
