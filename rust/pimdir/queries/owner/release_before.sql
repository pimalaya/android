-- Fork of RELEASE_BEFORE (sha256 49d3f38ed2640787) for SQLite 3.18:
-- `RETURNING` (3.35) as a read of the rows, then their update under the
-- same predicate, in one transaction.
--
-- The owner's release of the bodies of a set of mail collections (the
-- `collections` slot) below a sort key (§11.4): every live item whose
-- sort_key is below :before (RFC 3339 Z, NULL for no ceiling), the undated
-- ('') below any, that holds a body and needs it, back to Meta with its
-- summary, addresses, flags and bindings kept. It needs it while it is
-- conflicted, a binding of it is conflicted, has no base (a pending create)
-- or names another body as its base (a local edit), it has no binding, or a
-- source of the collection does not bind it (a propagation the body
-- delivers); such an item keeps it. release_bases_before runs first,
-- recompute_refcounts after, in the same transaction; the bodies fall to the
-- collector. Returns the seqs released.
