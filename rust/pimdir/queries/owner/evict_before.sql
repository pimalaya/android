-- Fork of EVICT_BEFORE (sha256 763d1eb3bd08b9ee) for SQLite 3.18:
-- `RETURNING` (3.35) as a read of the rows, then their delete under the same
-- predicate, in one transaction.
--
-- The owner's manual eviction of one mail collection below a date (§11.3):
-- every live item whose `date` is older than :before (RFC 3339 Z) and that
-- owes nothing, removed with its bindings, summary and addresses by cascade.
-- An item owes something while no source binds it (the store holds its only
-- copy), it is conflicted, a binding of it is conflicted or has no base (a
-- pending create), a binding of it is a delivered create's, based under a
-- provisional handle no listing has named yet (SYNC.md §5), its flags differ
-- from a binding's base flags, both known (an unpushed flag change), or a
-- person's reference names it, which no relisting restores; such an item
-- stays. The two sets differ by a system flag's bit or by a row either holds
-- and the other lacks, each direction an anti-join on the other's key, so no
-- set is gathered to be compared. An unknown `date` is never older. No
-- tombstone and no push: the remote keeps every member, and a widening
-- relists them. Retained rows are the purge's, not this. The cascade drops
-- pins no statement returns, so recompute_refcounts follows in the same
-- transaction; the delete trigger counts each row in `purges` (§4.5). Returns
-- the seqs evicted.
